# Cloud Computing

This is code as part of the CloudComputing Specialization on Coursera

It teaches low-level distributed computing concepts and high-level cloud architecture.

The projects are written in C++ and are found in the individual folders (each with their own README):
* `mp1` (building a membership protocol)
* `mp2` (building a distributed key-value store) is currently **IN PROGRESS**
